* Data validation

3. PKPASS Generation:

* Use a library to create a PKPASS file
* Incorporate the extracted data into a PKPASS file, including relevant event details, qr codes, extra info
* Stock and community-submitted templates for common e-tickets

4. Security Considerations:

* Implement security measures to encrypt sensitive information during the parsing and generation process
* Ensure compliance with data protection and privacy regulations

5. User Interface

6. Mobile Wallet Integration

* Integrate with device operating system and mobile wallet feature
* Implement whatever APIs or protocols for wallet integration
